# Advent of Code 2023
Some of my code for the Advent of Code 2023

Started participating on 12/15/2023. I do these challenges by myself for fun without looking at the answers. Since Advent of Code is unlike Leetcode in the fact that there is no time limit and it values correctness over performance, I do not optimize these challenge solutions.

Challenges done:
- Day 1 both parts (12/15)
- Day 2 both parts (12/15)
